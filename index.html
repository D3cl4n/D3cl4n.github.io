		Short Introduction
	</h1>
	<p>
		I am an aspiring cryptographer, interested in post-quantum cryptography and zero knowledge proofs. I currently work full-time as a computer scientist, studying cryptography, abstract algebra, and number theory in my spare time. I maintain a YouTube channel and Medium blog (detailed below), where I showcase my independant projects and learning. I enjoy teaching, and use both platforms to share what I have learned. I strive not only to implement ciphers, but to understand their underlying mathematical concepts, and implementation/design flaws that lead to cryptpanalysis. My goal is to start a PhD in cryptography in Fall of 2027, and I have my BS and MS from WPI, in computer science.
